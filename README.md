## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

        My project is designed to replicate the feedback page for Prime, its designed to take in: how youre feeling today, how well you were supported by the staff, how well you understand the material, and any further comments. All of these except the comments section is on a 1-5 scale, 5 being the best. I had a lot of bugs during this project, 90% of my entire time I spent on this project was just solving one bug after another. For example, I spent two days trying to figure out why the link in UnderstandingFeedback.js file wouldnt work, and it turns out that my links werent setup properly in my App.js.
